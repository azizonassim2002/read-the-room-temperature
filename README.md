Room Temperature Monitor – Arduino UNO

This modest open-source environmental sensor features an Arduino UNO and a DHT22 modular sensor.
The device continuously measures the room temperature and relative humidity of any indoor space and periodically pushes the readings to the Serial Monitor every 2 seconds. 
To build this sensor you  need just one 10 kΩ pull-up resistor and three jumper wires—you get your hands on a great little build that will be easy for a novice, but also fully featured enough for any maker wanting a drop-in room climate logger.
